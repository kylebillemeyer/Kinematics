Kinematics
==========

An implementation of [Inverse Kinematics]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_kinematics").

I did this with my friend, [Stephen Elliott]("https://github.com/Steell")for our class Advanced Geometric Computation and Representation (Special Topics in Graphics/Image Processing).
